DOM => Document object MOdel 


DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the entire HTML document as a tree structure where each node is an object representing a part of the page — elements, text, attributes, etc.
When a webpage loads, the browser creates a DOM of the page so JavaScript can interact with it.
